I'm a recent graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill with a B.S. in Computer Science and a second major in Religious Studies. My dream job would regularly give me the agency to employ knowledge sourced from both of these majors.

Studying religion allows my personality to thrive in this global context, while studying computer science helps my work to speak for itself.

Outside of the office, I’m passionate about criminal justice reform and spend time at the Durham County Youth Home. I’m also currently taking French lessons to better my research abilities in religion, but I take a lot of breaks to watch or play basketball.
